# Home Hub - Social Media Application

Home Hub is a comprehensive social media application where users can create posts about projects, like and comment on posts, manage their profile, and receive notifications.

The application is built with a React.js frontend, and an Express.js backend with a set of REST APIs.


## Technologies

Here's an overview of the technologies used to build this  application. 

### **M** is for MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a _NoSQL_ database program that stores data in collections of documents (in a format similar to JSON), rather than in tables. The application interacts with MongoDB using a tool called Mongoose.

### **E** is for Express
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is the Javascript equivalent of Sinatra. The structure of this application will feel quite different to what you're used to but the principles are the same.

### **R** is for React
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a hugely popular tool that is used to build engaging front ends. The basic principle is that the front end is split up into _components_, each of which _could_ include some logic, template structure (HTML) and styling (CSS).

### **N** is for Node
Java script was originally designed to run exclusively in browsers, such as Chrome. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a tool that allows you to run Javascript outside the browser and its invention made it possible to build full stack Javascript apps.

We also used...

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing on the back end
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing and component testing, on the front end
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for the `home` template.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.

## Architecture

This application is comprised of two distinct pieces.

- A backend API built with Express
- A front end built with React


## Quickstart

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently `18.1.0`.
   ```
   nvm install 18
   ```

### Start

1. Start the server

  **Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

   ```
   ; cd api
   ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm start
   ```
2. Start the front end

  In a new terminal session...

  ```
  ; cd frontend
  ; npm start
  ```

You should now be able to open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/signup` to create a new user.


### Testing


#### The Backend (API)

**Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

  Start the server in test mode (so that it connects to the test DB)

  ```
  ; cd api
  ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run start:test
  ```

  Then run the tests in a new terminal session

  ```
  ; cd api
  ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run test
  ```

#### The frontend (React)

**Note the use of an environment variable for the JWT secret**

  Start the server in test mode (so that it connects to the test DB)

  ```
  ; cd api
  ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run start:test
  ```

  Then start the front end in a new terminal session

  ```
  ; cd frontend
  ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm start
  ```

  Then run the tests in a new terminal session

  ```
  ; cd frontend
  ; JWT_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET npm run test
  ```
